# GoMano

Mano Assembly interpretter


##Planned features : 
* Converter Mano Assembly to Mano Opcodes
* Run Mano programs
* Compile C (subset) to Mano
* Register Reference Operations for operations 
* Definition of new intructions through Register Reference Ops
* Both 8 bit bus and 16 bit bus variants

##Notes :

The 8 bit bus variante still computes 16 bit numbers, it simply uses smarter register movements for all operations.
